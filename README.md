# File Retriever
Retrieves all files of a file type from a directory and moves to a new folder. Great for retrieving large amounts of files from a messy directory. If the file already exists in the destination folder, then it is not moved.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3 must be installed in order to run.
- Make sure to place file in root folder of drive you are working in. Then run the file in terminal.
